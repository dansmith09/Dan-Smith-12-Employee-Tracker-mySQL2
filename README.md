To use this application you first need to install all dependencies by navigating to the root folder and running

We then need to create and populate the database with information.

After navigating to the 'db' folder and logging in to mysql we do this by using

```
source schema.sql
```

and

```
source seeds.sql
```

Finally to initiate the application, we return to the root folder and use the command

```
node index.js
```
